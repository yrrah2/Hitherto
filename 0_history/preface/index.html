When one studies Marxism, and more importantly the surrounding theoretical works, it is not enough to simply read different works by different people. One needs to use Marxism on Marxism. In order to lay out the historic texts that surround Marxism and give it its context, one must do so in a Marxist way.

I have endeavored to find various Marxist sources covering the topic of the history of Marxism, as well as applied Marxist theory myself towards addressing the issue and have come to various conclusions.

We must divide the history of Marxism into 3 periods:

1. Pre-Marx: the context in which he was writing, the works he was familiar with and responding to, the works which shaped his worldview.
2. Marx and Engels.
3. Post-Marx: the theoreticians who carried forth the torch of Marxism into the 20th and 21st centuries.

As per Lenin's "Three Components", we must divide the pre-Marx material again into three parts:

1. German philosophy
2. English political economy
3. French socialism

The key figures for English political economy is easy. Nearly all works attribute the tradition of Marxian economics to Adam Smith and David Ricardo.

The figures of French socialism are more difficult, but Engels in his "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific" gives us Comte Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, and Robert Owen.

A concise list of German philosophical influences is more difficult.
