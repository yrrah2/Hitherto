When one studies Marxism, and more importantly the surrounding theoretical works, it is not enough to simply read different works by different people. One needs to use Marxism on Marxism. In order to lay out the historic texts that surround Marxism and give it its context, one must do so in a Marxist way.

I have endeavored to find various Marxist sources covering the topic of the history of Marxism, as well as applied Marxist theory myself towards addressing the issue and have come to various conclusions.

We must divide the history of Marxism into 3 periods:

1. Pre-Marx: the context in which he was writing, the works he was familiar with and responding to, the works which shaped his worldview.
2. Marx and Engels.
3. Post-Marx: the theoreticians who carried forth the torch of Marxism into the 20th and 21st centuries.

As per Lenin's "Three Components of Marxism", as well as his "Exposition of Marxism", we must divide the pre-Marx material again into three parts:

1. German philosophy
2. English political economy
3. French socialism (which in Exposition of Marxism is expanded "French socialism together with French revolutionary doctrines in general")

To find which figures inspired Marx and Engels, I will be looking at:
  
1. The Holy Family (1844)
2. The German Ideology (1844)
3. Philosophic & Economic Manuscripts (1844)
4. Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (1880)
5. Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy (1886)
  
These works give us the following people:
  
1. German philosophy
  a. Georg W.F. Hegel
  b. Ludwig Feuerbach
  c. Bruno and Edgar Bauer
  d. Max Stirner
2. English political economy
  a. Adam Smith
  b. David Riccardo
3. French socialism
  a. Comte Saint-Simon
  b. Charles Fourier
  c. Robert Owen
  d. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon

with some honourable mentions:
  
Arnold Ruge, David Strauss, Duhring
